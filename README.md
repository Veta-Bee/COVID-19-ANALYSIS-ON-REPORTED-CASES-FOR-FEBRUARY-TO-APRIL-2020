Introduction
This report provides a concise analysis of COVID-19 reported cases between February and April 2020. Drawing from a visual dashboard, it highlights trends in global and Nigerian case counts, death rates, and new infections. The analysis aims to inform public health insights and support data-driven responses to pandemic management.


Data Overview
The dashboard covers key statistics for both global and Nigerian contexts, including:

- Global Confirmed Cases: 14 million
- Total Global New Cases: 1.13 million
- Total Global Deaths: 675,000
- Total Cases in Nigeria: 2,075
- Total New Cases in Nigeria: 238
- Total Confirmed Cases in Nigeria: 1,837
- 

Data is broken down by month (February to April) and further segmented by daily Nigerian case trends, monthly global deaths, and case progression.
Dashboard Overview

Monthly Breakdown of Nigerian Cases:
- February: 1 case
- March: 138 new cases
- April: 99 new cases
  

Global Perspective:
- New Global Cases by Month:
  â€¢ March: 0.67M
  â€¢ April: 0.46M
  â€¢ February: Minimal

  
- Confirmed Cases Globally:
  â€¢ March: 8M (55.61%)
  â€¢ April: 6M (42.63%)
  â€¢ February: ~0.25M (1.75%)

  
- Total Global Deaths by Month:
  â€¢ March: 0.34M
  â€¢ April: 0.32M
  â€¢ February: 0.01M

Nigeria Trend Line (Daily Data):
- Daily confirmed cases in Nigeria rose gradually from early March, peaking at 232 cases by April 5.

  
Key Observations and Insights
1. Steady Rise in Nigeria: Nigeriaâ€™s daily confirmed cases show a sharp upward trend from mid-March, indicating local transmission acceleration.
2. March Was Peak Period Globally: Both global new cases and deaths peaked in March, accounting for over half of all confirmed cases during the period.
3. Lower Fatalities in February: February saw significantly fewer cases and deaths, suggesting that the global outbreak intensified in March.
4. Decline in April New Cases: Despite high total cases, April recorded fewer new cases globally than March, possibly due to early containment efforts.
5. Nigeria's Contribution Still Small: With only 2,075 total cases and 238 new cases, Nigeria contributed a small fraction of global numbers during this period.

   
Recommendations
- Continue Monitoring Trends: Surveillance should be sustained to detect emerging spikes in both global and local infection rates.
- Intensify Awareness in March/April: Targeted communication during high-risk months could improve community compliance and reduce case growth.
- Investigate Response Measures: Analyze interventions from March to understand what led to a decline in Aprilâ€™s new cases.
- Focus on Testing and Isolation in Nigeria: As Nigeriaâ€™s cases rose quickly, increasing testing and rapid isolation should be prioritized.
- Update Data Frequently: Ensure real-time updates to the dashboard for timely decisions and public engagement.

  
Conclusion
This dashboard-based analysis of COVID-19 from February to April 2020 reveals critical patterns in infection and mortality trends globally and within Nigeria. The insights reflect the dynamic progression of the pandemic and emphasize the importance of early response and continuous monitoring. Data from this period can guide preparedness for future health emergencies and shape policy for managing global outbreaks.

Remember those early days of COVID-19? When the world held its breath, and a silent storm began to rage? ðŸ˜„ My latest project takes us back to Feb-April 2020 to confront the raw, evolving story: COVID-19 ANALYSIS ON REPORTED CASES.


Using a vivid Power BI dashboard, I've unearthed critical patterns from those pivotal months, shedding light on a crisis that reshaped our world. This isn't just data; it's a look back at the immediate impact, revealing:
â€¢	Global Tsunami: Over 14M confirmed global cases , with March alone seeing 8M (55.61%) â€” a testament to how swiftly it spread.
â€¢	Nigeria's Awakening: From just 1 case in Feb to 138 new cases in March and 99 in April â€“ watching the curve rise in our own backyard.
â€¢	The Deadly Toll: A stark 675,000 global deaths in those three months , with March seeing the largest spike (0.34M).
â€¢	New Cases Surges: A chilling 1.13M new global cases and 238 new cases in Nigeria, reminding us of the daily battle.


Raw Insights & Urgent Truths: My analysis paints a clear picture: Nigeria's cases rose sharply from mid-March, a stark indicator of local transmission accelerating. Globally, March was the terrifying peak , accounting for over half of all confirmed cases. February felt like the calm before the storm. While April saw a slight dip in new global cases, the numbers were still staggering. Nigeria's contribution remained small then , but the upward trend was undeniable.


Why This Revisit Matters Deeply: This isn't just history; it's a crucial lesson. Understanding these early trends is vital for future preparedness , shaping robust public health responses, and honoring the monumental human cost. Every case, every life, teaches us invaluable lessons about resilience, response, and the power of data.
